brief: The 'rootcheck' tool allows to define policies in order to check if the agents
       meet the requirement specified. The rootcheck engine can check if a process is running, if a file is
       present and if the content of a file contains a pattern,
       or if a Windows registry key contains a string or is simply present.

                 are added, updated and deleted correctly.
                 For this purpose, the test will create a specific number of agents, and will check if they have
                 the rootcheck module enabled. Once this check is proven, it lets the rootcheck events to be sent
                 for 60 seconds. After the time has passed, the rootcheck module gets disabled and the test then
                 checks if the logs have been added to the database. After this first procedure, the test restarts
                 the service and let the rootcheck events to be sent for 60 seconds for checking after that time if
                 the logs have been updated with the new entries.
                 Lastly, the tests also checks if the logs are deleted from the database when sending the delete
                 table request.
